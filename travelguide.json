The island is covered mostly in dense jungle and fringed with white sandy beaches shaded by tall green trees. Diving in the crystal clear waters with shades of turquoise blue an experience that all must explore. Tourists simply love its picture perfect beaches, laid back vibe and amazing underwater world.",
                    "As far as islands in the Andamans go, Havelock is definitely the most tourism friendly and consequently the most visited. There are all sorts of accommodation options from bamboo cottages to luxury villas, great multinational cuisine restaurants, souvenir shops, ATMs and now even (slow but accessible) Internet caf√©s. You'll find almost everything you need here, but at a slower pace. And even though it is one of the most visited islands in the Andamans it sees only a fraction of the visitors that crowd other paradise destinations around the globe."

However, this route is quite tricky and not supported by tourism so you are at the mercy of your service providers. So, be careful of you attempting such a thing.<br>There you go the most bustling region of Andaman - Diglipur which will soon be a worthwhile travel destination in Andaman as plans of a second Andaman airport in Diglipur finalizes. So, think of all the exciting experiences you can try in this offbeat Andaman tourist destination."
